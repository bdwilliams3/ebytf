## Our Program Principles

### 🛡️ Safety First
Safety is our literal first priority. Coaching plans will begin with a safety message each day.
*   All coaches will be CPR certified.
*   At least one adult with concussion training will be on-site at all times.
*   Student **health** and **behavior** will be monitored to ensure any unusual occurrences are immediately addressed.
*   Student supervision and safety is the **number one metric** by which program success is measured.

### 🏅 Skills = Drills
Our goal is for your child to become a more well-rounded, confident athlete. To achieve this, we maximize repetitions.
*   Coaches deliver impactful and concise coaching points.
*   Attendees are organized to attempt each drill with enough repetitions to allow for real skill growth and improvement.

### 😄 Hard Fun
We believe in pushing to maximum effort while having a great time. Athletes should go home sweaty, tired, and smiling.
*   Coaches incorporate developmentally appropriate games and themed competitions.
*   This approach motivates athletes, brings enthusiasm, and unlocks the effort required to improve and compete.
