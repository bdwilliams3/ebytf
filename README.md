***Program Principles***
**Safety**
First, literally. Coaching plans will begin with the safety section each day. Coaches will be trained in CPR and certified. Atleast one adult with concussion training will be present and on site at all times during programming. Students *health* and *behavior* will be monitored to ensure any out of the ordinary occurences are immediately addressed by a trained staff member. Student supervision and safety will be the number 1 metric upon which the success of the program is rated before any others.

**Skills = Drills**
Our goal is your child leaves a more well rounded, confident athlete. In order to achieve this, we must maximize the number of at bats each athlete gets with each drill. Coaches will deliver impactful and concise coaching points, and ensure attendees are organized and situated to attempt each drill with enough repetititions to allow for improvement and skill growth.

**Hard Fun**
Attendees will push themselves to maximum effort while having fun. Your athletes should come home sweaty and tired and with smiles on their faces. Coaches will incorporate a variety of developmentally appropriate games and themes ito athletic movements and endurance competitions in order to motivate, bring enthusiasm, and unlock the effort required to improve and compete.

***Coaching***
Coaches will be held to the following standards:
    CPR Certified
    Attend 1hr Paid Coaching Clinic before season*
    No Swearing
    No Phones
    Bring ENTHUSIASM

Coaches will be given a station to run each session. They will be given a clipboard and practice plan.
Practice plan will include the safety message and warm-up for their initial group as well as the coaching points for the station they will running that day. Coaching points will include concise 1 or 2 phrase messages to repeat in order to boost the acquisition of skill mastery required for each movement in the drill.

*1 hour paid coaching clinic will be required in order to be a paid coach. All others will have to volunteer. We will go over the practice plan 1 week before the start of the camp season.

Attendees will register on day 1 and recieve a shirt according to their age group. They can put their shirt over their clothes or decide to wear it next time. The color of their shirt corresponds to the group they will be with primarily. However ahtletes may be asked to work with another age group for a variety of reasons (extra skill work, social timeout, recovery, etc). Day 1 they will be introduced to the general flow of practice. The location of each station and how to transition. Additionally, coaches will get attendees times and measurements in the following events:
